Game Idea List:
You are sent down to the bottom the of the ocean to retrieve ship wrecks and other objects of interest
You can stop at "oil rigs" where you can sell the stuff you find
The player starts in shallow and bright water, but as they progress, the water gets deeper and darker
The game should convey the feeling of utter dread and hopelessness
The deeper you go the weirder more cosmic horror like creatures you encounter
Player sub only has narrow fov
Game camera is above the player
